# Odin Recipes

This is a simple recipe website project created as part of The Odin Project's [Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com). 
The main objective of this project is to practice basic HTML skills, such as creating a website structure, adding links, images, and lists.

## Project Overview

The website consists of a main index page (`index.html`) that serves as the homepage, and a separate HTML file for each recipe. The recipe pages contain the recipe's name, an image of the dish, a description, a list of ingredients, and step-by-step instructions.

## Technologies Used

## Installation

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the website.

## Usage

The website is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate. Here's how you can use it:

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to access the homepage.
